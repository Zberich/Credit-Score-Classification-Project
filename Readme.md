In this project, using the the "Credit-score classifiacation" from kaggle, I will build a credit score classisification using Machine Learning tools. All the steps will be documented and explained in order to ease the understanding for any reader.
This is a comprehensive analysis and classification task based on the Credit Score Classification dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies individuals' credit scores. This work involves extensive data preprocessing, exploration, and model building to improve the insights and predictive power of the dataset.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Exploration and Visualization
Objective: Gain an understanding of each feature's distribution and assess the dataset's overall structure.
Process: Using various plots (histograms, box plots, etc.), we visualized individual feature distributions to spot trends, skewness, or anomalies in the data.
2. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Identified and removed missing values to ensure data integrity, minimizing any potential biases in the model.
Type Corrections: Corrected data types as necessary (e.g., transforming categorical features to the correct format).
Outliers: Detected and handled outliers to prevent skewed model training.
Consistency Checks: Ensured consistency across features by resolving data inconsistencies and normalizing ranges where needed.
3. Feature Analysis
Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between the target variable (credit score classification) and individual features to understand their impact on the target outcome.
Feature Engineering: Derived additional insights or transformed features where beneficial, supporting a more robust predictive model.
4. Modeling
Model : Classification algorithms :Random forest classifier for the credit score prediction. We could also experimented with several classification algorithms to find the model with optimal performance 
Evaluation: Evaluated models using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and refined model parameters to maximize classification accuracy.
